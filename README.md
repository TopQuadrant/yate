# YATE

This is a fork fo the YATE (https://github.com/perfectkb/yate) project from perfectkb (https://perfectkb.github.io/yate/)"

TQ had a need to support reified statements in the YATE editor, this project updates the grammars for such support.  TQ will do its best to keep up to date with YATE.
